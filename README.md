# Horiseon Refactor Project

## Description

This refactor project for the Horiseon webpage was to ensure that a codebase follows accessibility standards and search engine optimization. Ensuring a codebase has accessibility standards allows people with disabilities to read the website using assistive technologies. These technologies include video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Search engine optimization allows your website to become more visible and helps find the right customers for your business.
